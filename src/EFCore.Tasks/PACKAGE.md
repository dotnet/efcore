The Entity Framework Core MSBuild tasks integrate EF design-time tools into the build process. They're primarily used to generate the compiled model.

This package should be referenced by the project containing the derived `DbContext`.

## Usage

Install the package into your project, set `<EFOptimizeContext Condition="'$(Configuration)'=='Release'">true</EFOptimizeContext>` and then run build normally.

If the startup project is different from the current project it needs to be specified: `<EFStartupProject>..\Startup\Startup.csproj</EFStartupProject>`

The startup project must also reference the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tasks` package.
