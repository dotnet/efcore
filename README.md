Entity Framework
===
Entity Framework is Microsoft's recommended data access technology for new applications in .NET. 

## EF7 here, EF6 on CodePlex

This project is for Entity Framework 7, which is currently in pre-release. Entity Framework 6.x is the latest stable release of EF and still under active development on CodePlex at http://entityframework.codeplex.com/.

## Entity Framework 7

Entity Framework 7 (EF7) provides a familiar developer experience to previous versions of EF, including LINQ, POCO, and Code First support. EF7 also enables access to data across relational and non-relational stores. EF7 is much more lightweight than previous versions and is built from the ground up to work great in the cloud (using ASP.NET 5) on devices (i.e. in universal Windows apps) as well as in traditional .NET scenarios.

## Getting Started
To get started with EF7, see the [Entity Framework Wiki](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework/wiki).

## Roadmap
