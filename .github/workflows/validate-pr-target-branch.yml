# This workflow automatically closes PRs from external contributors (those without push permissions)
# that target branches other than 'main'. It posts a comment asking them to resubmit with the
# correct target branch.
#
# External contributors should always target the 'main' branch per our contribution guidelines.
# Internal contributors (with push permissions) can target release/* and feature/* branches as needed.
