It is a common problem in machine learning and natural language processing.  \r\n\r\nSince humans have the capacity to understand the meaning of a text document and extract the most important information from the original source using their own words, we are generally quite good at making summaries of a text. However, manual creation of summaries is very time consuming, and therefore a need for automatic summary has arisen. Not only are the automatic summarization tools much faster, they are also less biased than humans. \r\n\r\nNowadays, there are several methods of text summary, but there are two basic approaches to text summary that are based on the output type: extractive and abstractive. In an extractive summary, the most important sentences are extracted and joined to get a brief summary. The abstract text summary algorithms create new sentences and sentences that provide the most useful information from the original text - just as humans do. \r\n\r\nThis lecture provides insight into most common algorithms and tools used for automatic text summarization today, together with the methods used to evaluate automated summaries. \r\n"",

While C# has been pushing downwards into the realm of \""systems programming\"", Rust, a language that already operates in this space, has been pushing upwards. The result isn't a competition where one language must emerge as more universally applicable than the other. It's a broader set of cases where C# and Rust can work together, and integrating them effectively is more idiomatic thanks to this broadening of scope.\r\n\r\nWhen we set out in 2018 to rebuild the storage engine for our log server, Seq, we decided to complement our existing C# codebase with a new one written in Rust. In this talk we'll look at why you might want to add unmanaged code to your managed codebase, using Seq as an example. We'll explore how to use the tools that .NET and Rust give us to design and build a safe and robust foreign function interface. In the end we'll have a new perspective on the implicit safety contracts we're expected to uphold in our purely managed codebases."",

            ""description"": ""We’ve all heard a lot in the last year about a new advancement in the world of CSS, called CSS Grid. Starting off at whispers, we’re now starting to hear it as a deafening roar as more and more developers write about it, talk about it, share it and start using it. In the world of front end, I see it everywhere I turn and am excited as I start to use it in my own projects.\r\n\r\nBut what does this new CSS specification mean for software developers, and why should you care about it? In the world of tech today, we can do so many amazing things and use whatever language we choose across a wide range of devices and platforms. Whether it’s the advent of React and React Native, or frameworks like Electron, it’s easier than ever to build one app that works on multiple platforms with the language we know and work with best. The ability to do this also expands to styling apps on any platform using CSS, and therefore being able to utilise the magical thing that is\r\nCSS Grid.\r\n\r\nThe reason CSS Grid is gaining so much attention, is because it’s a game changer for front end and layouts. With a few simple lines of code, we can now create imaginative, dynamic, responsive layouts (yep, I know that’s a lot of buzz words). While a lot of people are calling this the new ‘table layout’, grid gives us so much more, with the ability to spread cells across columns and rows to whatever size you choose, dictate which direction new items flow, allow cells to move around to fit in place and even tell certain cells exactly where they need to sit.\r\n\r\nWhile there is so much to worry about when developing an app, CSS Grid means that you can worry less about building the layout on the front end, and more about making sure the back end works well. Let me show you how the magic works."",

While C# has been pushing downwards into the realm of \""systems programming\"", Rust, a language that already operates in this space, has been pushing upwards. The result isn't a competition where one language must emerge as more universally applicable than the other. It's a broader set of cases where C# and Rust can work together, and integrating them effectively is more idiomatic thanks to this broadening of scope.\r\n\r\nWhen we set out in 2018 to rebuild the storage engine for our log server, Seq, we decided to complement our existing C# codebase with a new one written in Rust. In this talk we'll look at why you might want to add unmanaged code to your managed codebase, using Seq as an example. We'll explore how to use the tools that .NET and Rust give us to design and build a safe and robust foreign function interface. In the end we'll have a new perspective on the implicit safety contracts we're expected to uphold in our purely managed codebases."",

With the support of C++ Insights (https://cppinsights.io) we will peak behind the scenes to answer questions about how they are implemented. We will also see how the compiler generated code changes, if we change the lambda itself. This is often interesting for development in constrained applications like the embedded domain.\r\n\r\nNext I will show you application areas of lambdas to illustrate where they can be helpful. For example, how they can help you to write less and with that more unique code.\r\n\r\nAfter the talk, you will have a solid understanding of lambdas in C++.

              ""description"": ""We’ve all heard a lot in the last year about a new advancement in the world of CSS, called CSS Grid. Starting off at whispers, we’re now starting to hear it as a deafening roar as more and more developers write about it, talk about it, share it and start using it. In the world of front end, I see it everywhere I turn and am excited as I start to use it in my own projects.\r\n\r\nBut what does this new CSS specification mean for software developers, and why should you care about it? In the world of tech today, we can do so many amazing things and use whatever language we choose across a wide range of devices and platforms. Whether it’s the advent of React and React Native, or frameworks like Electron, it’s easier than ever to build one app that works on multiple platforms with the language we know and work with best. The ability to do this also expands to styling apps on any platform using CSS, and therefore being able to utilise the magical thing that is\r\nCSS Grid.\r\n\r\nThe reason CSS Grid is gaining so much attention, is because it’s a game changer for front end and layouts. With a few simple lines of code, we can now create imaginative, dynamic, responsive layouts (yep, I know that’s a lot of buzz words). While a lot of people are calling this the new ‘table layout’, grid gives us so much more, with the ability to spread cells across columns and rows to whatever size you choose, dictate which direction new items flow, allow cells to move around to fit in place and even tell certain cells exactly where they need to sit.\r\n\r\nWhile there is so much to worry about when developing an app, CSS Grid means that you can worry less about building the layout on the front end, and more about making sure the back end works well. Let me show you how the magic works."",

              ""description"": ""Automatic text summarization is the process of shortening a text document by automatically creating a short, accurate, and fluent summary with the main points of the original document using software. It is a common problem in machine learning and natural language processing.  \r\n\r\nSince humans have the capacity to understand the meaning of a text document and extract the most important information from the original source using their own words, we are generally quite good at making summaries of a text. However, manual creation of summaries is very time consuming, and therefore a need for automatic summary has arisen. Not only are the automatic summarization tools much faster, they are also less biased than humans. \r\n\r\nNowadays, there are several methods of text summary, but there are two basic approaches to text summary that are based on the output type: extractive and abstractive. In an extractive summary, the most important sentences are extracted and joined to get a brief summary. The abstract text summary algorithms create new sentences and sentences that provide the most useful information from the original text - just as humans do. \r\n\r\nThis lecture provides insight into most common algorithms and tools used for automatic text summarization today, together with the methods used to evaluate automated summaries. \r\n"",

Tools such as clang-tidy offer ready-to-use source-to-source transformations. Available transformations can be used to modernize (use newer C++ language features), improve readability (remove redundant constructs), or improve adherence to the C++ Core Guidelines.\r\n\r\nHowever, when special needs arise, maintainers of large codebases need to learn some of the Clang APIs to create their own porting aids. The Clang APIs necessarily form a more-exact picture of the structure of C++ code than most developers keep in their heads, and bridging the conceptual gap can be a daunting task.\r\n\r\nTooling supplied with clang-tidy, such as clang-query, are indispensable in the discovery of the Clang AST.\r\n\r\nThis talk will show recent and future features in Clang tooling, as well as Tips, Tricks and Traps encountered on the journey to quality refactoring tools. The audience will see how mechanical refactoring in a large codebase can become easy, given the right tools.\r\n"",

We will review the properties of affine spaces and show how they improve program semantics, stronger type safety and compile time enforcement of these semantics.\r\n\r\nBy showing motivational examples, we will introduce you to the mathematical notion of affine spaces. The main focus will then be on how affine space types and their well defined semantics shape expressive APIs.\r\n\r\nWe will give examples and guidelines for creating your own affine types.

But what if there were an actual byte-code language you could compile your non-JavaScript code to instead? That is what WebAssembly is.\r\n\r\nI'm going to explain how WebAssembly works and how to use it in this talk. I'll cover what it is, how it fits into your application, and how to build and use your own WebAssembly modules. And, I'll demo how to build and use those modules with Rust, C++, and the WebAssembly Text Format. That's right, I'll be live coding in an assembly language. I'll also go over some online resources for other languages and tools that make use of WebAssembly.\r\n\r\nWhen we're done, you'll have the footing you need to start building applications featuring WebAssembly.

We stop, we fix, we repeat and refine. Like elite musicians, dedicated technical presenters typically spend many solitary hours doing this, which of course is necessary to master any content. But none of these practice processes has a place on the presentation stage. In presentation we must trust, believe, create, and keep going in the face of any adversity – a completely different process which in itself must be rehearsed.  \r\nIn order to give a magnificent presentation, we must PRACTICE giving a magnificent presentation. The only way to do this is by regularly and deliberately creating pressure situations in which we can practice NOT committing the presentation sins.\r\n\r\nCovering everything from wrong notes to blue screens of death, this dynamic and multi-talented pair not only break down the elements of successful and unsuccessful presentations, but also outline how one can give a truly engaging presentation every time, no matter how basic or complex the content."",

            ""description"": ""When building software, we often need to associate metadata with the code we’re writing. A typical example is when we need to tell our linters to ignore a specific range of code. A common approach to adding this metadata is to embed it directly in the code using the syntax of the language, but this approach has a number of drawbacks including language specificity, potential for collision, and cluttering of the code.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we’ll look at an alternative approach that stores the metadata separate from the code using a technique called _anchoring_. The metadata is associated with an anchor, a region of code inside the source file. Critically, the anchor also includes a context, a snapshot of the code surrounding the anchored region. As the source code is changed, this context – along with some very interesting algorithms for aligning text -– is used to automatically update the anchors.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate these concepts we’ll look at spor, a tool that implements anchoring and anchor updating. The primary implementation of spor is in Python, so it’s very approachable and, indeed, open for contribution. As a side note, we’ll also look at a partial implementation of spor written in Rust. Finally, we’ll look at how spor is being used in Cosmic Ray, a mutation testing tool for Python."",

This has lead to complex build pipelines that result in JavaScript which the browser has to parse and *you* still have to debug. But what if there were an actual byte-code language you could compile your non-JavaScript code to instead? That is what WebAssembly is.\r\n\r\nI'm going to explain how WebAssembly works and how to use it in this talk. I'll cover what it is, how it fits into your application, and how to build and use your own WebAssembly modules. And, I'll demo how to build and use those modules with Rust, C++, and the WebAssembly Text Format. That's right, I'll be live coding in an assembly language. I'll also go over some online resources for other languages and tools that make use of WebAssembly.\r\n\r\nWhen we're done, you'll have the footing you need to start building applications featuring WebAssembly.

We stop, we fix, we repeat and refine. Like elite musicians, dedicated technical presenters typically spend many solitary hours doing this, which of course is necessary to master any content. But none of these practice processes has a place on the presentation stage. In presentation we must trust, believe, create, and keep going in the face of any adversity – a completely different process which in itself must be rehearsed.  \r\nIn order to give a magnificent presentation, we must PRACTICE giving a magnificent presentation. The only way to do this is by regularly and deliberately creating pressure situations in which we can practice NOT committing the presentation sins.\r\n\r\nCovering everything from wrong notes to blue screens of death, this dynamic and multi-talented pair not only break down the elements of successful and unsuccessful presentations, but also outline how one can give a truly engaging presentation every time, no matter how basic or complex the content."",

              ""description"": ""Step back from your system and take a look at its architecture. Are the major structures and technology choices the result of conscious decisions, or have they emerged as the system has evolved? Architecture is often an ad hoc, responsive process where designs get stuck in local minima while ever more features are piled into the system. Such systems often fail to live up to the origin vision and expectations of stakeholders.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we look at how to design systems which are a purely a function of the major forces acting on a solution, rather than being modishly reflective of the prevailing software zeitgeist. We’ll explore the idea that software architecture, and hence software architects, should focus deliberately on the constraints and qualities of system design, and avoid getting too distracted by features."",

Only stand alone components reflected the basics of accessibility leaving full user flows behind. We forgot about our fellow coworkers and peers. Our engineers shouldered slow development times and new technologies, designs changed often, and variants were hard to implement. And we forgot about our users. Much of the design system was geared towards engineers, neglecting designers, product managers and more.\r\n\r\nSo what did we learn in our first iteration?

              ""description"": ""When building software, we often need to associate metadata with the code we’re writing. A typical example is when we need to tell our linters to ignore a specific range of code. A common approach to adding this metadata is to embed it directly in the code using the syntax of the language, but this approach has a number of drawbacks including language specificity, potential for collision, and cluttering of the code.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we’ll look at an alternative approach that stores the metadata separate from the code using a technique called _anchoring_. The metadata is associated with an anchor, a region of code inside the source file. Critically, the anchor also includes a context, a snapshot of the code surrounding the anchored region. As the source code is changed, this context – along with some very interesting algorithms for aligning text -– is used to automatically update the anchors.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate these concepts we’ll look at spor, a tool that implements anchoring and anchor updating. The primary implementation of spor is in Python, so it’s very approachable and, indeed, open for contribution. As a side note, we’ll also look at a partial implementation of spor written in Rust. Finally, we’ll look at how spor is being used in Cosmic Ray, a mutation testing tool for Python."",

In this session, we will strip them to bare math, so next time you use a machine learning library, you'll have a deeper understanding of what lies underneath.\r\n\r\nDuring this session, we will first provide a short history of machine learning and an overview of two basic teaching techniques: supervised and unsupervised learning.\r\n\r\nWe will start by defining what machine learning is and equip you with an intuition of how it works. We will then explain gradient descent algorithm with the use of simple linear regression to give you an even deeper understanding of this learning method. Then we will project it to supervised neural networks training.\r\n\r\nWithin unsupervised learning, you will become familiar with Hebb’s learning and learning with concurrency (winner takes all and winner takes most algorithms). We will use Octave for examples in this session; however, you can use your favorite technology to implement presented ideas.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to show the mathematical basics of neural networks for those who want to start using machine learning in their day-to-day work or use it already but find it difficult to understand the underlying processes. After viewing our presentation, you should find it easier to select parameters for your networks and feel more confident in your selection of network type, as well as be encouraged to dive into more complex and powerful deep learning methods.\r\n\r\nLevel: beginner\r\n"",

This talk will focus on portable source instrumentation techniques such as logging, tracing and metrics. Straightforward, but well designed code additions can drastically ease the troubleshooting of functional issues, and identification of performance bottlenecks, in production.\r\n\r\nOf course when dealing with C++ performance is often critical, and so minimizing the cost of any instrumentation is also critical. Key to this is understanding the trade-off between the detail of information collected, and the overheads of exposing that information. It is also important to understand how best to benefit from advances in contemporary monitoring infrastructure, popularised by cloud environments.\r\n\r\nThis talk will open with some brief motivation towards monitoring and instrumentation. It will then walk through some practical code examples using some generic instrumentation primitives, based on proven principles employed in demanding production software. "",

Many companies are talking about it, while very few are actually doing it. At Inmeta, we have together with partners and clients implemented 40+ machine learning projects in the past few years. In this talk, I will share the top 5 lessons we learned from doing machine learning for real.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 2: test && commit || revert. What?! - Kari Eline Strandjord\r\n\r\n`test && commit || revert` is a workflow developed during a week of code camp at Iterate with Kent Beck. The main idea is that your code should always be in a valid state. If the test passes, the code is committed. If it fails, you lose all your changes, and the code is forced back to the last valid state. At first, the idea seemed both unrealistic and a bit harsh. But after trying it out during a longer period writing an application in Elm, it did change my way of coding. \r\n\r\nThe talk will give a brief explanation of the workflow. I will also share my experiences from using it in a real project.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 3: Five Ways to Break a Git Repository - Edward Thomson\r\n\r\nCan you break your Git repository? I hope not! That's where you keep all your stuff! Edward Thomson shows you five common mistakes that break Git repositories and how to fix them.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 4: Unlocking the doors of parliament - Sindre Lindstad\r\n\r\nWhen Norway's Minister of Children and Families was instated, he enthusiastically showed the world the key to his new office through press photos.\r\n\r\nThe only problem was that it was a plastic punch-hole keycard, which meant anyone could make a copy.\r\n\r\nSo I made one with 3D printing (and lasers!). But does it work?\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------- "",

            ""description"": ""Ever since we started breaking applications into services, be it in the era of SOA or more recently with microservices, we’ve struggled to incorporate user interfaces into our decoupled, distributed architectures. We’ve seen frontends versioned separately with tight coupling to our services, breaking cohesion. We’ve seen the rise of Backend-For-Frontend and the emerge of micro frontends. We talk about composition, yet so many projects fail to implement actual composition. Instead we end up with some kind of compromise, with repeated business logic in the front-end, back-end and API, making it hard to scale – especially when multiple teams are involved – causing lock-step deployment, latency, bottlenecks and coordination issues.\r\n\r\nWhat if we could find a viable solution that allowed us to scale development, keep distribution and cohesion and also provide composition of user interfaces?\r\n\r\nIn this talk you are introduced to the evolution of compositional user interfaces and existing patterns while we discover their pros and cons, before diving into the architecture and development of compositional interfaces using hypermedia and micro-frontends. We go beyond the simple “Hello World” example that always seems to work, and you’ll learn patterns in modelling and design that will get you up and running with decoupled, composed user interfaces in your day job.\r\n"",

In this session, we will strip them to bare math, so next time you use a machine learning library, you'll have a deeper understanding of what lies underneath.\r\n\r\nDuring this session, we will first provide a short history of machine learning and an overview of two basic teaching techniques: supervised and unsupervised learning.\r\n\r\nWe will start by defining what machine learning is and equip you with an intuition of how it works. We will then explain gradient descent algorithm with the use of simple linear regression to give you an even deeper understanding of this learning method. Then we will project it to supervised neural networks training.\r\n\r\nWithin unsupervised learning, you will become familiar with Hebb’s learning and learning with concurrency (winner takes all and winner takes most algorithms). We will use Octave for examples in this session; however, you can use your favorite technology to implement presented ideas.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to show the mathematical basics of neural networks for those who want to start using machine learning in their day-to-day work or use it already but find it difficult to understand the underlying processes. After viewing our presentation, you should find it easier to select parameters for your networks and feel more confident in your selection of network type, as well as be encouraged to dive into more complex and powerful deep learning methods.\r\n\r\nLevel: beginner\r\n"",

              ""description"": ""Ever since we started breaking applications into services, be it in the era of SOA or more recently with microservices, we’ve struggled to incorporate user interfaces into our decoupled, distributed architectures. We’ve seen frontends versioned separately with tight coupling to our services, breaking cohesion. We’ve seen the rise of Backend-For-Frontend and the emerge of micro frontends. We talk about composition, yet so many projects fail to implement actual composition. Instead we end up with some kind of compromise, with repeated business logic in the front-end, back-end and API, making it hard to scale – especially when multiple teams are involved – causing lock-step deployment, latency, bottlenecks and coordination issues.\r\n\r\nWhat if we could find a viable solution that allowed us to scale development, keep distribution and cohesion and also provide composition of user interfaces?\r\n\r\nIn this talk you are introduced to the evolution of compositional user interfaces and existing patterns while we discover their pros and cons, before diving into the architecture and development of compositional interfaces using hypermedia and micro-frontends. We go beyond the simple “Hello World” example that always seems to work, and you’ll learn patterns in modelling and design that will get you up and running with decoupled, composed user interfaces in your day job.\r\n"",

This talk will focus on portable source instrumentation techniques such as logging, tracing and metrics. Straightforward, but well designed code additions can drastically ease the troubleshooting of functional issues, and identification of performance bottlenecks, in production.\r\n\r\nOf course when dealing with C++ performance is often critical, and so minimizing the cost of any instrumentation is also critical. Key to this is understanding the trade-off between the detail of information collected, and the overheads of exposing that information. It is also important to understand how best to benefit from advances in contemporary monitoring infrastructure, popularised by cloud environments.\r\n\r\nThis talk will open with some brief motivation towards monitoring and instrumentation. It will then walk through some practical code examples using some generic instrumentation primitives, based on proven principles employed in demanding production software. "",

Many companies are talking about it, while very few are actually doing it. At Inmeta, we have together with partners and clients implemented 40+ machine learning projects in the past few years. In this talk, I will share the top 5 lessons we learned from doing machine learning for real.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 2: test && commit || revert. What?! - Kari Eline Strandjord\r\n\r\n`test && commit || revert` is a workflow developed during a week of code camp at Iterate with Kent Beck. The main idea is that your code should always be in a valid state. If the test passes, the code is committed. If it fails, you lose all your changes, and the code is forced back to the last valid state. At first, the idea seemed both unrealistic and a bit harsh. But after trying it out during a longer period writing an application in Elm, it did change my way of coding. \r\n\r\nThe talk will give a brief explanation of the workflow. I will also share my experiences from using it in a real project.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 3: Five Ways to Break a Git Repository - Edward Thomson\r\n\r\nCan you break your Git repository? I hope not! That's where you keep all your stuff! Edward Thomson shows you five common mistakes that break Git repositories and how to fix them.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 4: Unlocking the doors of parliament - Sindre Lindstad\r\n\r\nWhen Norway's Minister of Children and Families was instated, he enthusiastically showed the world the key to his new office through press photos.\r\n\r\nThe only problem was that it was a plastic punch-hole keycard, which meant anyone could make a copy.\r\n\r\nSo I made one with 3D printing (and lasers!).

Using Azure B2C allows you to offload authentication to other identity providers while keeping authorization tasks local to your system.\r\n\r\nOffload the hassles of lost passwords, expiring accounts and more, leaving you time to build and maintain the things that are important to your system.\r\n\r\nAndrew will demonstrate the setup and configuration of this powerful identity federation system allowing integration of any combination of social identities such as Facebook or twitter, as well as organisational accounts like Active Directory and others. He'll also discuss the extension points allowing complete control of the identity system including rules-based identity flows and calling out to custom REST services as part of the claims processing flow,\r\n\r\nIf your system needs to include users from outside your organisation, this is a must-see session.\r\n"",
